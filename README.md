# 🌍 Renewable Energy Trends: Global Insights and Country Classifications Using AI-Based Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explored global renewable energy adoption from 2010 to 2023 using publicly available data from Our World in Data. The objective is to analyze historical patterns, identify top and bottom performers, and classify countries into clusters based on their renewable energy share trends, using a combination of data analytics and AI.

## 📁 Raw Dataset
- **Source**: [Our World in Data – Renewable Energy](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy)

## 📊 Insight & Findings
- Countries like **Iceland, Norway, and Sweden** consistently lead with over 60% renewable energy share.
- **Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia**, and others remain below 2%, showing minimal progress.
- The **Paris Agreement (2015)** showed positive but uneven influence across countries.
- Clustering analysis (KMeans) revealed **3 global behavior groups**:
  - 🟢 High Renewable Users  
  - 🔵 Moderate Adopters  
  - 🔴 Low Renewable Users
- Choropleth mapping and time-series visualization support these distinctions.

## 🤖 AI Support Explanation
AI was used to summarize analytical insights using the **IBM Granite model**, accessed via **Replicate API** and **LangChain** in Google Colab. The AI helped:
- Generate human-readable summaries of each cluster's energy behavior
- Translate numerical results into meaningful insights
- Enhance communication and presentation for both technical and non-technical audiences
